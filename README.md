# Dash-board

I started this project thinking in recreating a calculator fully functional. After getting that done, I decided to replicate part of Apple's dashboard with the idea of also recreating the Weather app. 

The UI should display the main apps (calculator and weather app) and these need to be fully functional.

Created with React.js: https://reactjs.org/.
I'm replicating Apple's dashboard from Apple's Macbook Pro.

1.- React-Calculator: Created with React. Created the calculator without watching any tutorials.

2.- React-WeatherApp: For the react-weatherapp I used the openweathermap.org API (https://openweathermap.org/api). Saw a couple of tutorials and read the documentation on how to use and connect the API to my react-app.

3.- React-CalendarApp: For the react-calendarapp, I added the react-moment package (https://momentjs.com/).
Read the documentation and found some tutorials to make the calendar work. Creating the calendar is way more difficult than creating the previous apps.

# APIs
 openweathermap API: to request the weather data. (https://openweathermap.org/api)



# Packages

react-draggable: Used to make the components draggable. https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable.
moment.js: Used to create the react-calendarapp. https://momentjs.com/
